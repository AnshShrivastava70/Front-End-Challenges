## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- Tailwind CSS  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- Mobile-first workflow  


### What I learned

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of CSS Grid and how to structure layouts efficiently. I also learned how to deploy projects using GitHub Pages, managing branches like `gh-pages` for hosting. Additionally, I gained confidence in using Git for version control, making it easier to manage any project seamlessly.

Now, I feel comfortable working with Git, GitHub, and deployment workflows for future projects. ðŸš€


### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to refine my skills in advanced CSS techniques, including better utilization of Grid and Flexbox for complex layouts. I also plan to improve my workflow with Git, exploring more efficient branching strategies and automation for deployments. Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding of accessibility and semantic HTML to enhance user experience.
