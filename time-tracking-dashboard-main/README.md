## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Flexbox & CSS Grid for layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- JSON for dynamic data fetching

### What I Learned

This project helped me reinforce several important concepts, including:

- Using **semantic HTML tags** to improve accessibility and structure.
- Fetching data from a **JSON file** using the `fetch()` API and dynamically rendering content.
- Revisiting and applying concepts I had forgotten, such as **DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with Tailwind CSS classes dynamically**.
- Strengthening my understanding of **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for responsive layouts.

Here are a few code snippets that Iâ€™m proud of:

```html
<!-- Example of a semantic HTML structure -->
<article>
  <header>
    <h3>Work</h3>
    <button class="menu-btn">
      <img src="./assets/images/icon-ellipsis.svg" alt="menu" />
    </button>
  </header>
  <p>32hrs</p>
  <footer>Last Week - 36hrs</footer>
</article>
```

```js
// Fetching data from a JSON file and updating the UI dynamically
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("./assets/data.json");
    jsonData = await response.json();
    generateCards();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error Fetching Data: ", error);
  }
}
```


### Continued Development  

This project helped me improve my skills in **semantic HTML, fetching data from a JSON file, and dynamically updating the UI using JavaScript**. However, there are still some things I want to work on:  

- **Better Handling of Fetch Requests** â€“ Learning how to optimize API calls to make the app more efficient.  
- **Managing State in JavaScript** â€“ Improving how I update and manage data in my projects.  
- **Using Tailwind CSS More Effectively** â€“ Exploring more Tailwind classes to write cleaner code.  
- **Making My Projects More Accessible** â€“ Ensuring buttons and other interactive elements work well for all users.  

Iâ€™ll focus on these areas in my future projects to keep improving.

### Useful Resources  

- [MDN Web Docs â€“ Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) â€“ Helped me understand how to get data from a JSON file.  
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) â€“ A great guide for styling with utility classes.  
- [JavaScript.info â€“ Async/Await](https://javascript.info/async-await) â€“ Made it easier to understand how to use async/await properly.  

These resources were very useful, and Iâ€™d recommend them to anyone learning JavaScript, APIs, and Tailwind CSS. ðŸš€
